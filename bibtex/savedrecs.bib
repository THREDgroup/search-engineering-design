Title = {{Opportunity discovery in initiated and emergent change requests}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 11}},
Abstract = {{When a change request is raised in an engineering project an ad hoc team
   often forms to manage the request. Prior research shows that
   practitioners often view engineering changes in a risk-averse manner. As
   a project progresses the cost of changes increases. Therefore, avoiding
   changes is reasonable. However, a risk-averse perspective fails to
   recognize that changes might harbor discoverable and exploitable
   opportunities. In this research, we investigated how practitioners of ad
   hoc teams used practices and praxes aimed at discovering and exploiting
   opportunities in engineering change requests. A single case study design
   was employed using change request records and practitioner interviews
   from an engineering project. 87 engineering change requests were
   analyzed with regards to change triggers, time-to-decision and rejection
   rate. In total, 25 opportunities were discovered and then 17 exploited.
   Three practices and six praxes were identified, used by practitioners to
   discover and exploit opportunities. Our findings emphasize the
   importance of the informal structure of ad hoc teams, to aid in
   opportunity discovery. The informal structure enables cross-hierarchal
   discussions and draws on the proven experience of the team members.
   Thus, this research guides project managers and presumptive ad hoc teams
   in turning engineering changes into successful opportunities.}},

Title = {{ADOPT: An augmented set-based design framework with optimisation}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 7}},
Abstract = {{During the early stages of any system design, a thorough exploration of
   the design space can prove to be challenging and computationally
   expensive. The challenges are further exacerbated when dealing with
   complex systems, such as an aircraft, due to the high dimensionality of
   their design space. Arising from the Toyota Product Development System,
   set-based design allows parallel evaluation of multiple alternative
   configurations in the early design stages. At the same time,
   optimisation methods can be employed at later stages to fine-tune the
   engineering characteristics of design variants. Presented in this paper,
   is the Augmented set-based Design and OPTimisation (ADOPT) Framework
   that introduces a novel methodology for integrating the two areas. This
   allows for a thorough design-space exploration while ensuring the
   optimality of the selected designs. The framework has been developed
   using a process-independent and tool-agnostic approach so that it can be
   applied to the design process of varying kinds of systems. To
   demonstrate the implementation and potential benefits, the framework has
   been applied to the design of a generic aircraft fuel system. The
   results from the case study and the framework itself are discussed, with
   a number of areas for further development and future work being
   identified and presented.}},

Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN 29}},
Abstract = {{The construction of future technological systems in work domains that do
   not yet exist, known as the envisioned world problem, is an increasingly
   important topic for designers, particularly given the rapid rate of
   technological advancement in the modern era. This paper first discusses
   the theoretical underpinnings of using cognitive work analysis (CWA) for
   developing a decision support system (DSS) situated within the
   envisioned world problem and recasts the problem as pathway-dependent
   processes. Using this pathway-dependent framework, each stage of the
   envisioning process is described to reveal how human factors experts can
   link existing work domains to envisioned instances. Finally, a case
   study example of the envisioning process that incorporates CWA modelling
   is demonstrated as it pertains to the advancement of the human
   spaceflight domain. As a result, this paper provides a unified treatment
   of the envisioned world problem with an end-to-end example of one
   approach to designing future technologies for future work domains.}},

Title = {{A framework for a systems design approach to complex societal problems}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Societal problems concern the complexity of technical, organisational,
   social, and political issues. The enormous negative impacts of these
   problems and the inability of problem solvers to deal with high levels
   of complexity cannot be overcome without a paradigm shift in how we
   understand and engage with such issues. Two domains have been helpful in
   bringing about such a shift: Systems Thinking and Design. Although these
   domains express mutual interest in social-technical systems and complex
   problem solving, in the literature there are few attempts of bringing
   the compatibility between them to the attention of designers. This paper
   aims to contribute to this endeavour by uncovering the role of
   integrating systems thinking for design, and by providing an overview of
   the emerging field of systems-oriented design approaches. An extensive
   literature review outlines significant aspects underlying systems
   thinking to support its use and further development in design. This
   paper provides a conceptual framework structured in five clusters:
   mindset, methodology set, knowledge set, skill set and tool set. The
   framework is meant to assist designers in integrating systems thinking
   into design and thereby enable them to better handle complex societal
   problems.}},

Title = {{Using a Product's Sustainability Space as a Design Exploration Tool}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN 7}},
Abstract = {{Sustainable design is often practiced and assessed through the
   consideration of three essential areas: economic sustainability,
   environmental sustainability, and social sustainability. For even the
   simplest of products, the complexities of these three areas and their
   tradeoffs cause decision-making transparency to be lost in most
   practical situations. The existing field of multiobjective optimization
   offers a natural framework to define and explore a given design space.
   In this paper, a method for defining a product's sustainability space
   (defined by economic, environmental, and social sustainability
   objectives) is outlined and used to explore the tradeoffs within the
   space, thus offering both the design team and the decision makers a
   means of better understanding the sustainability tradeoffs. This paper
   concludes that sustainable product development can indeed benefit from
   tradeoff characterization using multiobjective optimization techniques -
   even when using only basic models of sustainability. Interestingly, the
   unique characteristics of the three essential sustainable development
   areas lead to an alternative view of some traditional multiobjective
   optimization concepts, such as weak-Pareto optimality. The sustainable
   redesign of a machine to drill boreholes for water wells is presented as
   a practical example for method demonstration and discussion.}},

   repository mining}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Open Source Hardware (OSH) is an increasingly viable approach to
   intellectual property management extending the principles of Open Source
   Software (OSS) to the domain of physical products. These principles
   support the development of products in transparent processes allowing
   the participation of any interested person. While increasing numbers of
   products have been released as OSH, little is known on the prevalence of
   participative development practices in this emerging field. It remains
   unclear to which extent the transparent and participatory processes
   known from software reached hardware product development. To fill this
   gap, this paper applies repository mining techniques to investigate the
   transparency and workload distribution of 105 OSH product development
   projects. The results highlight a certain heterogeneity of practices
   filling a continuum between public and private development settings.
   They reveal different organizational patterns with different levels of
   centralization and distribution. Nonetheless, they clearly indicate the
   expansion of the open source development model from software into the
   realms of physical products and provide the first large-scale empirical
   evidence of this recent evolution. Therewith, this article gives body to
   an emerging phenomenon and contributes to give it a place in the
   scientific debate. It delivers categories to delineate practices,
   techniques to investigate them in further detail as well as a large
   dataset of exemplary OSH projects. The discussion of first results
   signposts avenues for a stream of research aiming at understanding
   stakeholder interactions at work in new product innovation practices in
   order to enable institutions and industry in providing appropriate
   responses.}},

Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{This paper provides an empirical review of the reward-based crowdfunding
   platform Kickstarter.com, with the aim to explore and identify
   challenges in crowdfunded product development, which consequently can
   lead to failure of the crowdfunding campaign. The review was based on
   the analysis of a total of 144 successfully funded technology'
   campaigns, which all concerned the creation of physical consumer
   hardware preordered by campaign backers. The analysis was built around a
   failure mode model, which was established through a pre-study. The study
   reveals that (i) no more than 32\% of the campaigns managed to deliver
   the crowdfunded products on time, and, if campaigns are delayed, (ii)
   there is a significantly higher probability that the delivered products
   might lack expected attributes. The causes for delay have many reasons,
   but (iii) a set of particular product development issues were identified
   as the main challenges. A better understanding of crowdfunded product
   development can help researchers and practitioners to better understand

Abstract = {{This paper builds on the author's keynote address to the Design
   Society's 21st International Conference on Engineering Design in 2017

   title. It begins by describing the engineering experience of the author
   which led to an understanding of the importance of taking a systems
   approach to the development of engineering products and services. This
   is followed by reflections on the development of a research portfolio
   focused on the design of complex engineering systems, inclusive design
   and healthcare improvement. The paper then reports on the recent work of
   engineers, clinicians and healthcare leaders, who came together under
   the guidance of the author, to explore how an engineering systems
   approach could be described that might simultaneously meet the needs of
   patients, carers and healthcare staff. It discusses the challenges
   associated with the translation of this narrative description of a
   systems approach (What?) into a practical implementation guide or
   toolkit (How?), supported by evidence of its effective use in health and
   care improvement practice. Finally, the paper reflects on the lessons to
   be learned from this process and their possible repercussions for design
   research and the practice of design.}},

Title = {{Design of urban electric bus systems}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{Many public transport authorities have a great interest in introducing
   zero-emission electric buses. However, the transformation process from
   diesel to electric bus systems opens up a vast design space which seems
   prohibitive for a systematic decision making process. We present a
   holistic design methodology to identify the most suitable system
   solution' under given strategic and operational requirements. The
   relevant vehicle technologies and charging systems are analysed and
   structured using a morphological matrix. A modular simulation model is
   introduced which takes technical and operational aspects into account.
   The model can be used to determine a feasible electric bus system. The
   technology selection is based on a detailed economic analysis which is
   conducted by means of a total cost of ownership (TCO) model. To cope
   with uncertainties in forecasting, a stochastic modelling of critical
   input parameters is applied and three different future scenarios are
   evaluated. The applicability of the model was verified in a pilot
   project in Berlin and the methodology was applied to a realistic
   operational scenario. Our results indicate that electric bus systems are
   technically feasible and can become economically competitive from the
   year 2025 under the conditions examined.}},

Title = {{Application of autoencoders in cyber-empathic design}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 30}},
Abstract = {{A critical task in product design is mapping information from the
   consumer space to the design space. This process is largely dependent on
   the designer to identify and relate psychological and consumer level
   factors to engineered product attributes. In this way, current
   methodologies lack provision to test a designer's cognitive reasoning
   and may introduce bias through the mapping process. Prior work on
   Cyber-Empathic Design (CED) supports this mapping by relating
   user-product interaction data from embedded sensors to psychological
   constructs. To understand consumer perceptions, a network of
   psychological constructs is developed using Structural Equation Modeling
   for parameter estimation and hypothesis testing, making the framework
   falsifiable in nature. The focus of this technical brief is toward
   automating CED through unsupervised deep learning to extract features
   from raw data. Additionally, Partial Least Square Structural Equation
   Modeling is used with extracted sensor features as inputs. To
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach a case study involving
   sensor-integrated shoes compares three models - a survey-only model (no
   sensor data), the existing CED approach with manually extracted sensor
   features, and the proposed deep learning based CED approach. The deep
   learning based approach results in improved model fit.}},

Title = {{Designing for social experiences with and within autonomous vehicles -
   exploring methodological directions}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{The introduction of autonomous vehicles (autonomous vehicles) will
   reshape the many social interactions that are part of traffic today. In
   order for autonomous vehicles to become successfully integrated, the
   social interactions surrounding them need to be purposefully designed.
   To ensure success and save development efforts, design methods that
   explore social aspects in early design phases are needed to provide
   conceptual directions before committing to concrete solutions. This
   paper contributes an exploration of methods for addressing the social
   aspects of autonomous vehicles in three key areas: the vehicle as a
   social entity in traffic, co-experience within the vehicle and the
   user-vehicle relationship. The methods explored include Wizard of Oz,
   small-scale scenarios, design metaphors, enactment and peer-to-peer
   interviews. These were applied in a workshop setting with 18
   participants from academia and industry. The methods provided
   interesting design seeds, however with differing effectiveness. The most
   promising methods enabled flexible idea exploration, but in a
   contextualized and concrete manner through tangible objects and
   enactment to stage future use situations. Further, combinations of
   methods that enable a shift between social perspectives were preferred.
   Wizard of Oz and small-scale scenarios were found fruitful as
   collaboration basis for multidisciplinary teams, by establishing a
   united understanding of the problem at hand.}},

Title = {{Creative exploration using topic-based bisociative networks}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Bisociative knowledge discovery is an approach that combines elements
   from two or more `incompatible' domains to generate creative solutions
   and insight. Inspired by Koestler's notion of bisociation, in this paper
   we propose a computational framework for the discovery of new
   connections between domains to promote creative discovery and
   inspiration in design. Specifically, we propose using topic models on a
   large collection of unstructured text ideas from multiple domains to
   discover creative sources of inspiration. We use these topics to
   generate a Bisociative Information Network - a graph that captures
   conceptual similarity between ideas - that helps designers find creative
   links within that network. Using a dataset of thousands of ideas from
   OpenIDEO, an online collaborative community our results show usefulness
   of representing conceptual bridges through collections of words (topics)
   in finding cross-domain inspiration. We show that the discovered links
   between domains, whether presented on their own or via ideas they
   inspired, are perceived to be more novel and can also be used as
   creative stimuli for new idea generation.}},

Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{Idea generation is significant in design, but coming up with creative
   ideas is often challenging. This paper presents a computer-based tool,
   called the Combinator, for assisting designers to produce creative
   ideas. The tool is developed based on an approach simulating aspects of
   human cognition in achieving combinational creativity. It can generate
   combinational prompts in text and image forms through combining
   unrelated ideas. A case study has been conducted to evaluate the
   Combinator. The study results indicate that the Combinator, in its
   current formulation, has assisted the tool users involved in the case
   study in improving the fluency of idea generation, as well as increasing
   the originality, usefulness, and flexibility of the ideas generated. The
   results also indicate that the tool could benefit its users in
   generating high-novelty and high-quality ideas effectively. The
   Combinator is considered to be beneficial in expanding the design space,
   increasing better idea occurrence, improving design space exploration,

Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{Human-centered design (HCD) offers a systematic approach to innovation
   practice, driven by customer research and feedback throughout the design
   process. Within the community of engineers and researchers who engage in
   design for global development, interest in HCD has grown in the past
   decade. In this paper, we examine the human-centered design for
   development (HCD+D) academic community to better understand the
   interactions between researchers. By building and evaluating a
   co-authorship network from a dataset of HCD+D papers, in which the nodes
   are researchers and the connecting links are co-authorship
   relationships, we provide a decade-long benchmark to answer a variety of
   questions about collaboration patterns within this emerging field. Our
   analysis shows that most HCD+D authors publish few papers and are part
   of small, well-connected sub-communities. Influential authors that
   bridge separate communities are few. HCD+D is emerging from disparate
   disciplines and widely shared scholarship across disciplines continues
   to be developed. Influential authors in HCD+D play a large role in
   shaping HCD+D, yet there are few authors that are in a position to
   connect and influence collaborative research. Our analysis gives rise to
   several implications including an increased need for cross-disciplinary
   collaboration and the need for a stronger core of HCD+D practitioners.}},

Title = {{Predicting product co-consideration and market competitions for
   technology-driven product design: a network-based approach}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 12}},
Abstract = {{We propose a data-driven network-based approach to understand the
   interactions among technologies, products, and customers. Specifically,
   the approach enables both a qualitative understanding and a quantitative
   assessment of the impact of technological changes on customers'
   co-consideration behaviors (decision of cross-shopping) and as a
   consequence the product competitions. The uniqueness of the proposed
   approach is its capability of predicting complex co-consideration
   relations of products as a network where both descriptive analyses
   (e.g., network statistics and joint correspondence analysis) and
   predictive models (e.g., multiple regressions quadratic assignment
   procedure) are employed. The integrated network analysis approach
   features three advantages: (1) It provides an effective visual
   representation of the underlying market structures; (2) It facilitates
   the evaluation of the correlation between customers' consideration
   preferences and product attributes as well as customer demographics; (3)
   It enables the prediction of market competitions in response to
   potential technological changes. This paper demonstrates the proposed
   network-based approach in a vehicle design context. We investigate the
   impacts of the fuel economy-boosting technologies and the turbocharged
   engine technology on individual automakers as well as the entire auto
   industry. The case study provides vehicle engineers with insights into
   the change of market competitions brought by technological developments
   and thereby supports attribute decision-making in vehicle design.}},

Title = {{The role of bridging nodes in behavioral network models of complex
   engineered systems}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAR 26}},
Abstract = {{Recent advances in early stage failure analysis approaches have
   introduced behavioral network analysis (BNA), which applies a
   network-based model of a complex engineered system to detect the
   system-level effect of `local' failures of design variables and
   parameters. Previous work has shown that changes in microscale network
   metrics can signify system-level performance degradation. This article
   introduces a new insight into the influence of the community structure
   of the behavioral network on the failure tolerance of the system through
   the role of bridging nodes. Bridging nodes connect a community of nodes
   in a system to one or more nodes or communities outside of the
   community. In a study of forty systems, it is found that bridging nodes,
   under attack, are associated with significantly larger system-level
   behavioral degradation than non-bridging nodes. This finding indicates
   that the modularity of the behavioral network could be key to
   understanding the failure tolerance of the system and that parameters
   associated with bridging nodes between modules could play a vital role
   in system degradation.}},

   examines PSSs from an interdisciplinary angle by analyzing how
   engineering design and marketing inform one another, as well as presents
   insights for PSS design. The research is carried out using a three-stage
   process for analyzing and evaluating interdisciplinary research: first,
   through a systematic literature review to identify relevant papers and
   their level of utilization across disciplines; second, by using a
   qualitative thematic analysis looking for different perspectives in
   order to find themes to bridge the gap between the disciplines; and
   third, by providing a research agenda to advance research by moving from
   silos to synergy. The results show a limited use of theories,
   frameworks, methods and tools across disciplines thus far, while the
   major contribution of this article lies in the implications derived for
   PSS design for academics and practitioners alike, which are categorized
   into seven specific themes: business orientation, collaboration, cost
   aspects, flexibility, performance indicators, requirements and services.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a concept for a community innovation platform is
   introduced focusing on human behavior of motivation and barriers in the
   context of product generation development. Building on the state of the
   art, a three year case study in cooperation with Dr. Ing. h.c. F.
   Porsche AG is at the core. In the first step of the study, a
   questionnaire and interviews are used to point out that a new attractive
   channel for ideas is needed. The three perspectives of users, experts
   and stakeholders are investigated in order to discover needs and
   preferences. Based on these findings, in a second step, a software
   prototype was designed and introduced in a pilot project with more than
   200 users. Using a questionnaire and expert workshops, in the final
   step, this project is evaluated as appealing to the community, and the
   generated content is demonstrated to be valuable to specific activities

Title = {{tAffordance based interactive genetic algorithm (ABIGA)}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{Designers can involve users in the design process. The challenge lies in
   reaching multiple users and finding the best way to use their input in
   the design process. Affordance based design (ABD) is a design method
   that focuses in part on the perceived or existing interactions between
   the user and the artifact. The shape and physical characteristics of the
   product enable the user to perceive some of its affordances. The goal of
   this research is to use ABD, along with an optimization tool, to evolve
   the shape of products toward better perceived solutions using the input
   from users. A web application has been developed that evolves design
   concepts using an interactive multi-objective genetic algorithm (IGA)
   relying on the user assessment of product affordances. As a proof of
   concept, a steering wheel is designed using the application by having
   users rate specific affordances of solutions presented to them. The
   results show that the design concepts evolve toward better perceived
   solutions, allowing designers to explore more solutions that reflect the
   preferences of end users. Relationships between affordances and product
   design variables are also explored, revealing that specific affordances
   can be targeted with changes in design parameter values and highlighting
   the tie between physical characteristics and affordances.}},

Title = {{Extraction and evaluation of transportation network grammars for
   efficient planning applications}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 19}},
Abstract = {{Grammars, with their generic approach and broad application potential in
   many planning fields, are accepted as adaptable and efficient tools for
   design and planning applications, bridging design rules and technical
   planning requirements. This paper provides a formal introduction of
   grammars for effective consolidation and application, including a
   rule-based notation and required specification information. Two proposed
   grammar evaluation methods - based on technical planning knowledge and
   using recent computational development - foster understanding of a
   grammars effects, often missing in other definitions. Knowledge gained
   enables efficient grammar rule application, e.g. in burgeoning planning
   software. This research focuses particularly on urban network design and
   road intersection grammars to validate proposed grammar evaluation
   methods. Results are specified in the proposed grammar notation with
   corresponding application specifications. Results generally show that
   network topology and intersection type choice both depend on transport
   mode characteristics and flow. Specifically, medium-dense gridiron
   networks are car-efficient in terms of travel costs and reliability at
   urban densities, when combined with high road and intersection
   capacities. Pedestrian networks ideally have higher intersection and
   road densities with lower capacities than car networks. Highly meshed
   networks improve overall travel cost efficiencies for all transport
   modes at various flow levels.}},

Title = {{Open-design: A state of the art review}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 18}},
Abstract = {{The `open approach' is rooted in the open-source and free-software
   movements. Its application has spread to more fields than computer
   engineering. Product design is impacted as well: we observe new
   stakeholders and practices challenging current structured design
   processes and leading to industrial successes. Open-design appears to be
   promising yet disruptive. Moreover, its distinctive features remain
   unclear.
   This paper aims to popularize this new concept, as well as to give both
   researchers and practitioners an overview of current research on
   open-design, and its consequences on design. For this, we conducted a
   systematic quantitative bibliometric analysis of 624 entries
   corresponding to the keyword open-design' in the Scopus database. This
   supports a qualitative synthesis of scientific literature, enabling us
   to summarize practices falling under the umbrella term open-design'. As
   such, this paper traces the evolution of product design and the open
   approach. It also analyzes the impact of open-design on the design
   process as presented in the scientific literature. Finally, this paper
   develops a typology of open-design of tangible artifacts that
   distinguishes among three currently reported varieties of practice:
   do-it-yourself, meta-design, and industrial ecosystems. As the major
   contribution of this paper, this typology is developed as a final
   discussion.}},

Title = {{Observing network characteristics in mass collaboration design projects}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 16}},
Abstract = {{Mass collaboration efforts can increase innovation and design
   possibilities. Incorporation of open innovation into the product
   development process allows for a vast array of unique perspectives and
   ideas. However, with the broad expansion of design possibilities,
   coordination of these development processes is paramount. To best make
   use of open innovation in product development, increased organizational
   efforts must be considered. The mass collaboration of individuals must
   account for individual intellectual abilities (competencies), working
   experience and even personality traits or idiosyncrasies. Approaches to
   this problem require the fusion of social network analysis with
   quantifiable design impacts. This work proposes a simulation framework
   that evaluates the design potential of a project team based on
   individual attributes and the team network structure. The overall
   contribution of this work comes from the exploration of team structure,
   focusing on network composition metrics such as centrality and network
   density, while attempting to understand the role of individual ability
   and positioning on the success of the design process. This work aims to
   garner a more thorough understanding of how the network structure of
   design teams correlates with their potential performance through a
   generalized simulation framework, applicable to future crowd and design

Title = {{Design process robustness: a bipartite network analysis reveals the
   central importance of people}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 11}},
Abstract = {{Design processes require the joint effort of many people to collaborate
   and work on multiple activities. Effective techniques to analyse and
   model design processes are important for understanding organisational
   dynamics, for improving collaboration, and for planning robust design
   processes, reducing the risk of rework and delays. Although there has
   been much progress in modelling and understanding design processes,
   little is known about the interplay between people and the activities
   they perform and its influence on design process robustness. To analyse
   this interplay, we model a large-scale design process of a biomass power
   plant with 100+ people and similar to 150 activities as a bipartite
   network. Observing that some people act as bridges between activities
   organised to form nearly independent modules, in order to evaluate
   process fragility, we simulate random failures and targeted attacks to
   people and activities. We find that our process is more vulnerable to
   attacks to people rather than activities. These findings show how the
   allocation of people to activities can obscure an inherent fragility,
   making the process highly sensitive and dependent on specific people.
   More generally, we show that the behaviour of robustness is determined
   by the degree distributions, the heterogeneity of which can be leveraged
   to improve robustness and resilience to cascading failures. Overall, we
   show that it is important to carefully plan the assignment of people to
   activities.}},

Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes the Uncertainty Driven Action (UDA) model, which
   unifies the fragmented literature on design activity. The UDA model
   conceptualises design activity as a process consisting of three core
   actions: information action, knowledge-sharing action, and
   representation action, which are linked via uncertainty perception. The
   foundations of the UDA model in the design literature are elaborated in
   terms of the three core actions and their links to designer cognition
   and behaviour, utilising definitions and concepts from Activity Theory.
   The practical relevance and theoretical contributions of the UDA model
   are discussed. This paper contributes to the design literature by
   offering a comprehensive formalisation of design activity of individual
   designers, which connects cognition and action, to provide a foundation
   for understanding previously disparate descriptions of design activity.}},

Title = {{Patent stimuli search and its influence on ideation outcomes}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Prior studies on design ideation have demonstrated the efficacy of using
   patents as stimuli for concept generation. However, the following
   questions remain: (a) From which part of the large patent database can
   designers identify stimuli? (b) What are their implications on ideation
   outcomes? This research aims to answer these questions through a design
   experiment of searching and identifying patent stimuli to generate new
   concepts of spherical rolling robots. We position the identified patent
   stimuli in the home, near and far fields defined in the network of
   patent technology classes, according to the network's community
   structure and the knowledge proximity of the stimuli to the spherical
   rolling robot design. Significant findings are: designers are most
   likely to find patent stimuli in the home field, whereas most patent
   stimuli are identified in the near field; near-field patents stimulate
   the most concepts, which exhibit a higher average novelty; combined
   home- and far-field stimuli are most beneficial for high concept
   quality. These findings offer insights on designers' preferences in
   search for patent stimuli and the influence of stimulation distance on
   ideation outcomes. The findings will also help guide the development of
   a computational tool for the search of patents for design inspiration.}},

Title = {{Can Pahl and Beitz' systematic approach be a predictive model of
   designing?}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Pahl and Beitz' `Systematic Approach' is generally seen as a
   prescriptive model of designing based on observations of professional
   design practice. In this paper, we examine whether this model can be
   used as a predictive model. This is done by testing its predictive
   capacity for the design behaviour of students that are formally taught
   design and design methods. The behavioural observations used in this
   study are based on protocols of 15 design sessions involving mechanical
   engineering students after their first year of design education and 31
   design sessions of the students using various concept generation
   methods. The design protocols and the Systematic Approach are coded
   uniformly using the Function-Behaviour-Structure (FBS) design issue
   schema. Cumulative occurrence analysis is used to derive qualitative and
   quantitative measures as a basis for comparison between the Systematic
   Approach's prediction and the students' design behaviour. The results
   indicate that the Systematic Approach can predict some but not all of
   students' design issue behaviour.}},

Title = {{The impact of vehicle silhouettes on perceptions of car environmental
   friendliness and safety in 2009 and 2016: a comparative study}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Automakers are interested in creating optimal car shapes that can
   visually convey environmental friendliness and safety to customers. This
   research examined the influence of vehicle form on perceptions based on
   two subjective inference measures: safety and perceived environmental
   friendliness (PEF). A within-subjects study was conducted in 2009 (Study
   1) to study how people would evaluate 20 different vehicle silhouettes
   created by designers in industry. Participants were asked to evaluate
   forms on several scales, including PEF, safety, inspired by nature,
   familiarity, and overall preference. The same study was repeated in 2016
   (Study 2). The results from the first study showed an inverse
   relationship between PEF and perceptions of safety. That is, vehicles
   that appeared to be safe were perceived to be less environmentally
   friendly, and vice versa. Participants in the second study showed a
   similar trend, but not as strongly as the 2009 participants. Several
   shape variables were identified to be correlated with participants' PEF
   and safety ratings. The changes in the trend of participants'
   evaluations over seven years were also discussed. These results can
   provide designers with insights into how to create car shapes with
   balanced PEF and safety in the early design stage.}},

Title = {{The characterisation of engineering activity through email communication
   and content dynamics, for support of engineering project management}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Significant challenge exists in the effective monitoring and management
   of engineering design and development projects. Due to traits such as
   contextual variation and scale, detailed understanding of engineering
   projects and activity are difficult to form, with monitoring hence
   reliant on interpretation of managerial personnel and adherence to
   defined performance indicators. This paper presents a novel approach to
   the quantitative monitoring and analysis of engineering activity through
   computational topic identification and analysis of low-level
   communication data. Through three metrics of communication activity,
   this approach enables detailed detection and tracking of activity
   associated with specific project work areas. By application to 11,832
   emails within two industry email corpora, this work identifies four
   distinct patterns in activity, and derives seven characteristics of
   communication activity within engineering design and development.
   Patterns identified are associated with background discussion, focused
   working, and the appearance of issues, supporting detailed managerial
   understanding. Characteristics identified relate to through-process
   norms against which a manager may compare and assess. Such
   project-specific information extends the ability of managers to
   understand the activity within their specific project scenario. Through
   detailed description of activity and its characteristics, in tandem with
   existing toolsets, a manager may be supported in their interpretation
   and decision-making processes.}},

Title = {{The novelty `sweet spot' of invention}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Invention arises from novel combinations of prior technologies. However,
   prior studies of creativity have suggested that overly novel
   combinations may be harmful to invention. Apart from the factors of
   expertise, market, etc., there may be such a thing as too much' or too
   little' novelty that will determine an invention's future value, but
   little empirical evidence exists in the literature. Using technical
   patents as the proxy of inventions, our analysis of 3.9 million patents
   identifies a clear sweet spot' in which the mix of novel combinations of
   prior technologies favors an invention's eventual success. Specifically,
   we found that the invention categories with the highest mean values and
   hit rates have moderate novelty in the center of their combination space
   and high novelty in the extreme of their combination space. Too much or
   too little central novelty suppresses the positive contribution of
   extreme novelty in the invention. Furthermore, the combination of
   scientific and broader knowledge beyond patentable technologies creates
   additional value for invention and enlarges the advantage of the novelty
   sweet spot. These findings may further enable data-driven methods both
   for assessing invention novelty and for profiling inventors, and may
   inspire a new strand of data-driven design research and practice.}},

Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Technologies are created through the collective efforts of individual
   inventors. Understanding inventors' behaviors may thus enable predicting
   invention, guiding design efforts or improving technology policy. We
   examined data from 2.8million inventors' 3.9million patents and found
   that most patents are created by explorers': inventors who move between
   different technology domains during their careers. We mapped the space
   of latent relatedness between technology domains and found explorers
   were 250 times more likely to enter technology domains that were highly
   related to the domains of their previous patents, compared to an
   unrelated domain. The great regularity of inventors' behavior enabled
   accurate prediction of individual inventors' future movements: a model
   trained on just 5 years of data predicted inventors' explorations 30
   years later with a log-loss below 0.01. Inventors entering their most
   related domains were associated with patenting up to 40\% more in the
   new domain, but with reduced citations per patent. These findings may be
   instructive for inventors exploring design directions, and useful for
   organizations or governments in forecasting or directing technological
   change.}},

Title = {{Modelling the dynamics of complex early design processes: anagent-based
   approach}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{Among the different phases of complex design processes, early design is
   the most dynamic and unpredictable stage since it involves a great deal
   of uncertainty, concurrency of activity streams, collaborative design
   iterations, and distributed and adaptive decision-making behaviour in
   response to both organizational commitments and to the occurrence of
   unforeseen events. This paper argues that current activity-based
   modelling approaches have limited ability to capture the dynamics of
   complex early design processes and explores novel modelling approaches.
   The development of an Agent Model for Planning and rEsearch of eaRly
   dEsign (AMPERE) aiming to capture various facets of uncertainty,
   iteration, collaboration and adaptation is described. The model was
   developed to tackle early design phases of complex systems, with the
   ability to deal with changes in requirements coming in and affecting the
   subsequent design evolution while design tasks are on-going. Initial
   results from agent-based simulations are presented, showing how the
   agent-based approach can support industrial organizations evaluating
   likely early design project performance and understanding complex
   cause-effect relationships that may affect project outcomes. Early
   design planning support from the agent model is demonstrated through an
   investigation to the likely project performance for varying levels of
   externally driven requirements change.}},

Title = {{Network models for mapping educational data}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{OCT 25}},
Abstract = {{Educational mapping is the process of analyzing an educational system to
   identify entities, relationships and attributes. This paper proposes a
   network modeling approach to educational mapping. Current mapping
   processes in education typically represent data in forms that do not
   support scalable learning analytics. For example, a curriculum map is
   usually a table, where relationships among curricular elements are
   represented implicitly in the rows of the table. The proposed network
   modeling approach overcomes this limitation through explicit modeling of
   these relationships in a graph structure, which in turn unlocks the
   ability to perform scalable analyses on the dataset. The paper presents
   network models for educational use cases, with concrete examples in
   curriculum mapping, accreditation mapping and concept mapping.
   Illustrative examples demonstrate how the formal modeling approach
   enables visualization and learning analytics. The analysis provides
   insight into learning pathways, supporting design of adaptive learning
   systems. It also permits gap analysis of curriculum coverage, supporting
   student advising, student degree planning and curricular design at
   scales ranging from an entire institution to an individual course.}},

Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{In the last few years, numerous approaches have been introduced for
   supporting design engineers in developing more sustainable products.
   However, so far, these efforts have not led to the establishment of a
   commonly acknowledged standard methodology for Sustainable Product
   Development (SPD). This brings into question the relevance of developing
   new methods and calls for more efforts in testing the available ones.
   This article provides a reflection about the benefits and obstacles of
   applying existing SPD approaches to a real product development project.
   It reports the results of a project aimed at developing a new mobility
   solution under the constraints of sustainability-related targets. This
   project has led to the development of a new pedelec concept, focusing on
   the substitution of small passenger cars with the help of three SPD
   methods - Design for Sustainability Guidelines, Product Sustainability
   Index, and Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment. These methods have
   proved to be generally beneficial, thanks to a combination of
   qualitative and quantitative perspectives. However, the multitude of
   criteria offered by the methods put forth difficulties in evaluating
   which sustainability aspects are relevant and therefore lead to higher
   effort for information retrieval analysis and decision processes.
   Furthermore, the methods still lack an integrated perspective on the
   product, the corresponding services and the overarching system.}},

Title = {{The generation of problem-focussed patent clusters: a comparative
   analysis of crowd intelligence with algorithmic and expert approaches}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{OCT 11}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new crowdsourcing approach to the construction of
   patent clusters, and systematically benchmarks it against previous
   expert and algorithmic approaches. Patent databases should be rich
   sources of inspiration which could lead engineering designers to novel
   solutions for creative problems. However, the sheer volume and
   complexity of patent information means that this potential is rarely
   realised. Rather than the keyword driven searches common in commercial
   systems, designers need tools that help them to understand patents in
   the context of the problem they are considering. This paper presents an
   approach to address this problem by using crowd intelligence for
   effective generation of patent clusters at lower cost and with greater
   rationale. A systematic study was carried out to compare the crowd's
   efficiency with both expert and algorithmic patent clusters, with the
   results indicating that the crowd was able to create 80\% more patent
   pairs with appropriate rationale.}},

Title = {{An investigation on using serious gaming to study human decision-making
   in engineering contexts}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{Serious gaming is the use of games for purposes beyond entertainment. In
   this paper, we investigate the use of serious gaming as a tool for
   research into decision-making in engineering systems design. Serious
   gaming provides a fully controllable environment in which to study the
   decision-making behavior of engineers in simulated design scenarios.
   However, given the nature of games and their inherent association with
   entertainment, it is possible that gaming environments themselves induce
   unexpected, or unrepresentative behavior. We present two experiments in
   which we investigate serious gaming as a research tool. Both experiments
   deal with design decisions in the presence of sunk costs and compare two
   approaches for communicating the decision-making scenario: (1) an
   interactive game and (2) a written narrative. The written narrative
   approach for communicating decision making scenarios is a widely used
   and accepted technique for decision-making research. We find that
   behavior observed in the game variants did not significantly differ from
   behavior observed in their written narrative equivalents. This result
   builds confidence for the use of game-based research approaches.
   However, the results in this paper suggest that response distributions
   collected from a game have more noise than those from an equivalent
   written narrative.}},

Title = {{Sharedness of team mental models in the course of design-related
   interaction between architects and clients}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{This study deals with the role of mental models in the coordination of
   team activities during design problem-solving. The work centers on the
   sharedness of mental models in a design team setting, mainly on the
   interaction between an architect and two clients. A major goal is to
   gain insight into how modifications in mental models affect
   coordination, and how sharedness develops through the process. Our focus
   is to explore, through a case study, the individual contributions of the
   architect and the clients to coordination of the work process, and how
   sharedness of the development of the team mental model evolves in the
   early stage of concept generation. Our claim is that work teams develop
   a certain degree of sharedness of the mental models of individual team
   members during information exchange. This team mental model can be
   insufficient or even wrong, but as long as the team members feel
   agreement in the team, they coordinate their work on that basis. Thus,
   sharedness of mental models is believed to be a powerful team asset,
   especially when it is reached in the earlier phases of the design
   process. Our findings suggest that in order to attain sharedness among
   design team members, design activities related to the task mental model
   should be encouraged, specifically the generation of new ideas and the
   analysis of solutions. Implications for practice and education are
   suggested.}},

Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{To better understand the impact of early versus late design decisions, a
   study was undertaken on the root causes of missed requirements in new
   product development and their impact on development cost through rework
   activities. The context is the industrial development of unmanned aerial
   vehicles. The aim is to understand the occurrence rate of missed
   requirements, their root causes, and their relative impact. A
   quantitative approach of counting requirements changes and using
   engineering documentation enabled traceability from observation back to
   root cause origin. The development process was partitioned into
   sequential program segments, to categorize activities to before and
   after concept and design freeze. We found that there was a significant
   difference in the rate of design defects arising before and after
   concept freeze; and found there was a significantly higher number of
   corrective activities required for design defects arising earlier before
   concept freeze. The revision rate of concept phase decisions was over
   50\%, and the rework multiplier if detected late was over 10X. In
   combination, design decisions made before design freeze accounted for
   86\% of the total expected program cost, and 34\% was determined before
   concept freeze. These results quantify and support the anecdotal 80-20
   impact rule for design decisions.}},

Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG 3}},
Abstract = {{Prototyping is interwoven with nearly all product, service, and systems
   development efforts. A prototype is a pre-production representation of
   some aspect of a concept or final design. Prototyping often
   predetermines a large portion of resource deployment in development and
   influences design project success. This review surveys literature
   sources in engineering, management, design science, and architecture.
   The study is focused around design prototyping for early stage design.
   Insights are synthesized fromcritical reviewof the literature: key
   objectives of prototyping, critical review of major techniques,
   relationships between techniques, and a strategy matrix to connect
   objectives to techniques. The review is supported with exemplar
   prototypes provided fromindustrial design efforts. Techniques are
   roughly categorized into those that improve the outcomes of prototyping
   directly, and those that enable prototyping through lowering of cost and
   time. Compact descriptions of each technique provide a foundation to
   compare the potential benefits and drawbacks of each. The review
   concludes with a summary of key observations, highlighted opportunities
   in the research, and a vision of the future of prototyping. This review
   aims to provide a resource for designers as well as set a trajectory for
   continuing innovation in the scientific research of design prototyping.}},

Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL 24}},
Abstract = {{This research presents a pilot study that explores the use of quantified
   Gestalt principles of symmetry, parallelism, and continuity as design
   variables to evaluate the aesthetics of three-dimensional product
   representations. To this end, a virtual reality (VR)-based discrete
   choice experiment was conducted to elicit subjects' preferences among
   pairs of bottle forms with diverse Gestalt values. While immersed in the
   VR environment, 42 participants were able to visually explore the whole
   forms, thus capturing more information to develop their judgment.
   Further analysis of the choice data using standard and mixed logit
   regression with hierarchical Bayes estimation provides initial details
   on the aesthetic utility of the Gestalt principles in question, their
   distribution among the sample participants, and the correlation between
   estimates. Due to the small sample size, the results are not expansible
   and they only apply to the data set gathered during the experiment.
   Nevertheless, it is an initial proof of concept which could suggest that
   symmetry and continuity have a positive aesthetic effect over people,
   and that parallelism could have opposite aesthetic utilities for women
   and men. This methodology allows designers to delve into the integration
   of aesthetics as a quantifiable property in the product development
   process.}},

Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports findings from the first systematic review of protocol
   studies focusing specifically on conceptual design cognition, aiming to
   answer the following research question: What is our current
   understanding of the cognitive processes involved in conceptual design
   tasks carried out by individual designers? We reviewed 47 studies on
   architectural design, engineering design and product design engineering.
   This paper reports 24 cognitive processes investigated in a subset of 33
   studies aligning with two viewpoints on the nature of designing: (V1)
   design as search (10 processes, 41.7\%); and (V2) design as exploration
   (14 processes, 58.3\%). Studies on search focused on solution search and
   problem structuring, involving: long-term memory retrieval; working
   memory; operators and reasoning processes. Studies on exploration
   investigated: co-evolutionary design; visual reasoning; cognitive
   actions; and unexpected discovery and situated requirements invention.
   Overall, considerable conceptual and terminological differences were
   observed among the studies. Nonetheless, a common focus on memory,
   semantic, associative, visual perceptual and mental imagery processes
   was observed to an extent. We suggest three challenges for future
   research to advance the field: (i)developing general models/theories;
   (ii)testing protocol study findings using objective methods conducive to
   larger samples and (iii)developing a shared ontology of cognitive
   processes in design.}},

Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{Archetype in Greek means an original basis that prevails in all later
   forms. In the field of design, types and archetypes have been used as
   analytical tools; unfortunately, they have not been perceived as
   promising prospects in the search for creative ideas, and the dynamic
   transformative quality embedded in archetypes has not been fully
   utilized in the ideation process. This research is an exploration of
   re-establishing the value of implementing archetypes as generative
   abstractions in the initial phase of the ideation process. The
   fundamental structure of archetypes was redefined based on the dual
   structure of a core signal and a peripheral, and an interactive genetic
   algorithm (IGA) was implemented to visualize the transformative quality
   embedded in archetypes. In order to emphasize the experiential property
   of archetypes, the proposed system was designed to offer users the
   opportunity to view their exploration in a virtual environment (VE).
   Emphasis was placed on the artful use of technology in the pre-logical
   stage of the ideation process based on the theory of archetypes. This
   paper reports on the results from the experiment based on six museum
   archetypes focusing on (1) the system's generative quality; (2) the
   synthesis + evolution function; and (3) VE integration.}},

Title = {{Human-centered design of complex systems: An experience-based approach}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{This position paper presents a new approach based on my experience in
   the evolution of human-centered design (HCD) during four decades, and
   how it has struggled to become a discipline in its own right in complex
   socio-technical systems' creation, development and operations. The 20th
   century saw tremendous industrial developments based on tangible
   materials that were transformed and assembled to make washing machines,
   cars, aircraft and power plants; during its last three decades,
   electronics and software were incrementally added to hardwaremachines.
   Operationalization issuesmoved fromhardware to software, making
   automation and user interfaces central issues. From the beginning of the
   21st century, we began to do the exact opposite! Currently, we typically
   start a project by designing and developing technology on computers,
   using software only, which is later transformed into hardware (and
   software). I denote this shift, the `socio-technical inversion'.
   Operationalization issues are moving from software to hardware, making
   tangibility a central issue. Three useful conceptualmodels are
   presented: the SFAC (Structure/Function versus Abstract/Concrete) model;
   the NAIR (Natural/Artificial versus Cognitive/Physical) model; and the
   AUTOS (Artifact, User, Task, Organization and Situation) pyramid.
   Concepts developed in this article are based on the rationalization of a
   long experience in the aerospace domain.}},

Title = {{Towards a shared ontology: A generic classification of cognitive
   processes in conceptual design}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY 22}},
Abstract = {{Towards addressing ontological issues in design cognition research, this
   paper presents the first generic classification of cognitive processes
   investigated in protocol studies on conceptual design cognition. The
   classification is based on a systematic review of 47 studies published
   over the past 30 years. Three viewpoints on the nature of design
   cognition are outlined (search, exploration and design activities),
   highlighting considerable differences in the concepts and terminology
   applied to describe cognition. To provide a more unified view of the
   cognitive processes fundamentally under study, we map specific
   descriptions of cognitive processes provided in protocol studies to more
   generic, established definitions in the cognitive psychology literature.
   This reveals a set of 6 categories of cognitive process that appear to
   be commonly studied and are therefore likely to be prevalent in
   conceptual design: (1) long-term memory; (2) semantic processing; (3)
   visual perception; (4) mental imagery processing; (5) creative output
   production and (6) executive functions. The categories and their
   constituent processes are formalised in the generic classification. The
   classification provides the basis for a generic, shared ontology of
   cognitive processes in design that is conceptually and terminologically
   consistent with the ontology of cognitive psychology and neuroscience.
   In addition, the work highlights 6 key avenues for future empirical
   research: (1) the role of episodic and semantic memory; (2) consistent
   definitions of semantic processes; (3) the role of sketching from
   alternative theoretical perspectives on perception and mental imagery;
   (4) the role of working memory; (5) the meaning and nature of synthesis
   and (6) unidentified cognitive processes implicated in conceptual design
   elsewhere in the literature.}},

Title = {{Applying organizational psychology as a design science: A method for
   predicting malfunctions in socio-technical systems (PreMiSTS)}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY 4}},
Abstract = {{As a discipline, design science has traditionally focused on designing
   products and associated technical processes to improve usability and
   performance. Although significant progress has been made in these areas,
   little research has yet examined the role of human behaviour in the
   design of socio-technical systems (e.g., organizations). Here, we argue
   that applying organizational psychology as a design science can address
   this omission and enhance the capability of both disciplines.
   Specifically, we propose a method to predict malfunctions in
   socio-technical systems (PreMiSTS), thereby enabling them to be designed
   out or mitigated. We introduce this method, describe its nine stages,
   and illustrate its application with reference to two high-profile case
   studies of such malfunctions: (1) the severe breakdowns in patient care
   at the UK's Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust hospital in the
   period 2005-2009, and (2) the fatal Grayrigg rail accident in Cumbria,
   UK, in 2007. Having first identified the socio-technical and behavioural
   antecedents of these malfunctions, we then consider how the PreMiSTS
   method could be used to predict and prevent future malfunctions of this
   nature. Finally, we evaluate the method, consider its advantages and
   disadvantages, and suggest where it can be most usefully applied.}},

Title = {{Agile product engineering through continuous validation in PGE - Product
   Generation Engineering}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY 2}},
Abstract = {{Most products are developed in generations. This needs to be considered
   with regard to development methods and processes to make existing
   knowledge available to achieve increased efficiency. To realize this,
   the approach of PGE - product generation engineering - is formulated.
   Product generation engineering is understood as the development of
   products based on reference products (precursor or competitor products).
   The subsystems are either adapted to the new product generation by means
   of carryover or they are newly developed based on shape variation or
   principle variation. Validation is considered as the central activity in
   the product engineering process and is a major challenge, especially for
   complex mechatronic systems. Therefore, it is important to understand
   validation as an ongoing activity during product development. The pull
   principle of validation describes the definition and development of
   validation activities, including models and validation environments
   based on specific validation objectives. In order to have effectiveness
   within validation of subsystems, it is necessary to map the interactions
   with the overall system, namely the super-system. The relevant
   subsystems can be connected under consideration of functional and
   energetic aspects by means of virtual, physical or mixed
   virtual-physical modeling applied by the holistic IPEK-X-in-the-Loop
   approach within the integrated Product engineering Model (iPeM).}},

Title = {{The principle of reflexive practice}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY 2}},
Abstract = {{`Practice what you preach' is a phrase occasionally used to refer to
   those not acting as they want others to act. There are countless
   opportunities in professional work and daily life to bring such
   criticism upon ourselves. While the subject is broad, this study focuses
   on the application of this idea in research practice, and more
   specifically in design research. One point of departure is the question:
   `how should we practice research if its results are products just like
   other products?' The Principle of Reflexive Practice (PRP) states that
   considering the outcome of design research or research itself as a
   product, many design principles, tools, methods or knowledge are
   applicable to design research.
   A corollary of the principle is that in order to succeed in contemporary
   research environments, design researchers would gain significant benefit
   such as improving the success rate of their research projects, if they
   exercise design methods and tools in designing their research. By
   exercising these methods, researchers would gain quick and rich feedback
   about the methods they develop; they would become aware of issues that
   require users' perspective that could not be possible without their own
   practical use.
   The PRP makes participants in design research aware of the reflexive
   opportunity in studying design that could be mobilized to advancing
   their practice and making their research results more effective.
   Notwithstanding, adopting the PRP is not easy; therefore, it is
   presented as a challenge to design research. Four examples of using the
   PRP as a guiding principle in research are presented to demonstrate its
   importance and benefits.}},

Title = {{Impossible by design? Fairness, strategy, and Arrow's impossibility
   theorem}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{FEB 23}},
Abstract = {{The design process often requires work by teams, rather than
   individuals. During team based design it is likely that situations will
   arise in which individual members of the team have different opinions,
   yet a group decision must still be made. Unfortunately, Arrow's
   impossibility theorem indicates that there is no method for aggregating
   group preferences that will always satisfy a small number of `fair'
   conditions. This work seeks to identify methods of combining individual
   preferences that can come close to satisfying Arrow's conditions,
   enabling decisions that are fairer in practice. First, experiential
   conjoint analysis was used to obtain individual empirical utility
   functions for drinking mug designs. Each empirical utility function
   represented individual members who were part of a design team. Then, a
   number of functions for constructing group preference were analysed
   using both randomly generated preferences and empirical preferences
   derived from the experiential conjoint survey. The analysis involved
   checking each of Arrow's conditions, as well as assessing the potential
   impact of strategic voting. Based on the results, methods that should be
   used to aggregate group preference within a design team in practice were
   identified and recommended.}},

Title = {{Model granularity in engineering design - concepts and framework}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{JAN 19}},
Abstract = {{In many engineering design contexts models are indispensable. They offer
   decision support and help tackle complex and interconnected design
   projects, capturing the underlying structure of development processes or
   resulting products. Because managers and engineers base many decisions
   on models, it is crucial to understand their properties and how these
   might influence their behaviour. The level of detail, or granularity, of
   a model is a key attribute that results from how reality is abstracted
   in the modelling process. Despite the direct impact granularity has on
   the use of a model, the general topic has so far only received limited
   attention and is therefore not well understood or documented. This
   article provides background on model theory, explores relevant
   terminology from a range of fields and discusses the implications for
   engineering design. Based on this, a classification framework is
   synthesised, which outlines the main manifestations of model
   granularity. This research contributes to theory by scrutinising the
   nature of model granularity. It also illustrates how this may manifest
   in engineering design models, using Design Structure Matrices as an
   example, and discusses associated challenges to provide a resource for
   modellers navigating decisions regarding granularity.}},

   also provide the designer with new insights, which play an important
   role in the emergence of ideas. However, some studies tend to show that
   sketching does not systematically have a positive effect on idea
   generation. Our research thus aims to analyze the generative effects of
   sketches by studying the way sketches support the design strategy of
   designers. We especially focus on the role of knowledge in comparison
   with concepts. Three sequences of sketches are analyzed employing C-K
   design theory; we show that drawings refer to both concepts and
   knowledge, but mostly to knowledge. In particular, sketching helps the
   architect mobilize knowledge distant from the initial topic. Moreover,
   the designer carries out through sketching an important work of
   knowledge structuration that we call `knowledge preordering'; by
   carefully selecting, testing and, if necessary, removing knowledge, the
   designer organizes a strategically built knowledge space. In particular,
   all elements involving modularity or determinism in the knowledge basis
   are abandoned. Such knowledge preordering thus allows the building of a
   splitting knowledge structure, which offers new rules for concept
   generation and enhances the production of original and disruptive ideas.}},

Title = {{Using hypothetical product configurators to measure consumer preferences
   for nanoparticle size and concentration in sunscreens}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Although nanoparticles have been shown to have clear technological
   advantages, their use in some consumer products remains controversial,
   particularly where these products come in direct contact with our
   bodies. There has been much discussion about using metal oxide
   nanoparticles in sunscreens, and numerous technology assessments aimed
   at predicting the type, size and concentration of nanoparticles and
   surface treatments that will be best for consumers. Yet, the optimal
   configuration is ultimately the one that people actually want and are
   willing to pay for, but until now consumer preferences have not been
   included in model predictions. We describe and discuss a proof of
   concept study in which we design and implement a hypothetical sunscreen
   product configurator to predict how people tradeoff sun protection
   factor (SPF), product transparency and potential toxicity from reactive
   oxygen species (ROS) in configuring their most preferred sunscreen. We
   also show that preferred nanoparticle sizes and concentrations vary
   across demographic groups. Our results suggest that while consumers
   choose to reduce or eliminate potential toxicity when possible, they do
   not automatically sacrifice high SPF and product transparency to avoid
   the possibility of toxicity from ROS. We discuss some advantages of
   using product configurators to study potential product designs and
   suggest some future research possibilities.}},

Title = {{Modeling customer preferences using multidimensional network analysis in
   engineering design}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by overcoming the existing utility-based choice modeling
   approaches, we present a novel conceptual framework of multidimensional
   network analysis (MNA) for modeling customer preferences in supporting
   design decisions. In the proposed multidimensional customer-product
   network (MCPN), customer-product interactions are viewed as a
   socio-technical system where separate entities of customers' and
   products' are simultaneously modeled as two layers of a network, and
   multiple types of relations, such as consideration and purchase, product
   associations, and customer social interactions, are considered. We first
   introduce a unidimensional network where aggregated customer preferences
   and product similarities are analyzed to inform designers about the
   implied product competitions and market segments. We then extend the
   network to a multidimensional structure where customer social
   interactions are introduced for evaluating social influence on
   heterogeneous product preferences. Beyond the traditional descriptive
   analysis used in network analysis, we employ the exponential random
   graph model (ERGM) as a unified statistical inference framework to
   interpret complex preference decisions. Our approach broadens the
   traditional utility-based logit models by considering dependency among
   complex customer-product relations, including the similarity of
   associated products, irrationality' of customers induced by social
   influence, nested multichoice decisions, and correlated attributes of
   customers and products.}},

Abstract = {{Inspiration is a widely recognized phenomenon in everyday life. However,

   inspirational stimuli during the initial phases of a design process. We
   conducted a think-aloud protocol study and interviews with 31 design

   results indicate that searching for and selecting stimuli require
   different levels of cognitive effort, depending on whether there is
   unlimited or limited access to stimuli. Furthermore, three important
   stages of the inspiration process were identified: keyword definition,
   stimuli search and stimuli selection. For each of these stages, we
   elaborate on how designers define keywords, which search approaches they
   use and what drives their selection of stimuli. This paper contributes
   to an understanding of how designers can be supported in their
   inspiration process in a more detailed manner.}},

Title = {{Balancing design freedom and brand recognition in the evolution of
   automotive brand styling}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{Designers faced with the task of developing a new product model of a
   brand must balance several considerations. The design must be novel and
   express attributes important to the customers, while also recognizable
   as a representative of the brand. This balancing is left to the
   intuition of the designers, who must anticipate how customers will
   perceive the new design. Oftentimes, the design freedom used to meet a
   product attribute can compromise the recognition of the product as a
   member of the brand. In this paper, an experiment is conducted for
   measuring changes in ten styling attributes common to both design
   freedom and brand recognition for automotive designs from four brands,
   Audi, BMW, Cadillac, and Lexus, using customer responses to two-and
   three-dimensional vehicle designs created and presented interactively
   through a crowdsourced web application. Results show that while brand
   recognition is highly dependent on the manufacturer, two brands have
   strong negative relationship between design freedom and brand
   recognition, suggesting that these two manufacturers face a significant
   challenge when evolving their respective brand styling. This study is a
   first effort toward quantifying and predicting tradeoffs between design
   freedom and brand recognition, contributing to existing efforts that
   augment human intuition during strategic design decisions.}},

Title = {{Modeling of technological performance trends using design theory}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Functional technical performance usually follows an exponential
   dependence on time but the rate of change (the exponent) varies greatly
   among technological domains. This paper presents a simple model that
   provides an explanatory foundation for these phenomena based upon the
   inventive design process. The model assumes that invention novel and
   useful design arises through probabilistic analogical transfers that
   combine existing knowledge by combining existing individual operational
   ideas to arrive at new individual operating ideas. The continuing
   production of individual operating ideas relies upon injection of new
   basic individual operating ideas that occurs through coupling of science
   and technology simulations. The individual operational ideas that result
   from this process are then modeled as being assimilated in components of
   artifacts characteristic of a technological domain. According to the
   model, two effects (differences in interactions among components for
   different domains and differences in scaling laws for different domains)
   account for the differences found in improvement rates among domains
   whereas the analogical transfer process is the source of the exponential
   behavior. The model is supported by a number of known empirical facts:
   further empirical research is suggested to independently assess further
   predictions made by the model.}},

   expert justification of design methods and towards empirical validation}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{MAY 18}},
Abstract = {{This paper gives a general and logical analysis of the expert position
   in design research by which methods for innovative design can be derived
   from expert design practices. It first gives a framework for
   characterising accounts of design by the way in which they define and
   relate general, descriptive and prescribed types of design practices.
   Second, it analyses with this framework the expert position's
   conservatism of prescribing existing expert design practices to
   non-expert designers. Third, it argues that the expert status of expert
   designers does not provide sufficient justification for prescribing
   expert design practices to non expert designers; it is shown that this
   justification needs support by empirical testing. Fourth, it discusses
   validation of design methods for presenting an approach to this testing.
   One consequence of the need to empirically test the expert position is
   that its prescription has to be formulated in more detail. Another
   consequence is that it undermines the expert position since expert
   design practices are not anymore certain sources for deriving design
   methods with. Yet it also opens the expert position to other sources for
   developing design methods for innovation, such as the practices of
   contemporary designers and the insights of design researchers.}},

Title = {{Public investment and electric vehicle design: a model-based market
   analysis framework with application to a USA-China comparison study}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{MAY 4}},
Abstract = {{Governments encourage use of electric vehicles (EV) via regulation and
   investment to minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Manufacturers
   produce vehicles to maximize profit, given available public
   infrastructure and government incentives. EV public adoption depends not
   only on price and vehicle attributes, but also on EV market size and
   infrastructure available for refueling, such as charging station
   proximity and recharging length and cost. Earlier studies have shown
   that government investment can create EV market growth, and that
   manufacturers and charging station operators must cooperate to achieve
   overall profitability. This article describes a framework that connects
   decisions by the three stakeholders (government, EV manufacturer,
   charging station operator) with preferences of the driving public. The
   goal is to develop a framework that allows the effect of government
   investment on the EV market to be quantified. This is illustrated in
   three scenarios in which we compare optimal public investment for a city
   in USA (Ann Arbor, Michigan) and one in China (Beijing) to minimize
   emissions, accounting for customer preferences elicited from surveys
   conducted in the two countries. Under the modeling assumptions of the
   framework, we find that high customer sensitivity to prices, combined
   with manufacturer and charging station operator profit maximization
   strategies, can render government investment in EV subsidies
   ineffective, while a collaboration among stakeholders can achieve both
   emission reduction and profitability. When EV and station designs
   improve beyond a certain threshold, government investment influence on
   EV adoption is attenuated apparently due to diminishing customer
   willingness to buy. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that a
   diversified government investment portfolio could be especially
   effective for the Chinese market, with charging costs and price cuts on
   license plate fees being as important as EV subsidies.}},

Title = {{Improving design grammar development and application through
   network-based analysis of transition graphs}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{APR 19}},
Abstract = {{Design grammars enable the formal representation of a vocabulary and
   rules that describe how designs can be synthesized just as the grammar
   rules of a spoken language define how to formulate valid, i.e.,
   grammatically correct, sentences. Design grammars have been successfully
   applied in numerous engineering disciplines and enable the automated
   synthesis of designs within a defined design language. Design grammar
   development, however, is challenging and lacks methodological support.
   In this paper, a novel method is presented that supports the development
   and application of design grammars using transition graphs. In these,
   nodes represent generated designs and edges represent grammar rules that
   transformone design into another. Rather than using a tree structure to
   represent the possible application of rules, transition graphs are
   automatically generated and used to help designers better understand the

   (a) improve the grammar, and (b) apply it more efficiently. Two case

Title = {{A qualitative study of collaborative stimulation in group design
   thinking}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{APR 5}},
Abstract = {{It is often assumed in both education and industry that collaboration
   encourages creativity. This assumption is explored by investigating the
   influence of designers' interactions on creativity-relevant thinking
   processes by extending creative cognition to the group design context.
   It is proposed that sharing design entities and questions stimulates
   creativity-relevant thinking processes through four types of
   collaborative stimulation. Specific patterns are hypothesized to exist
   between each type of collaborative stimulation and thinking processes. A
   case study was conducted to determine whether the hypothesized types and
   patterns of collaborative stimulation exist. The results were analyzed
   using a directed coding approach and collaborative retrospective
   protocol analysis, which enable capturing both internal thoughts and
   external interactions with minimal interference to collaboration. The
   results indicate that the identified types of collaborative stimulation
   are observable and that they have recognizable patterns with stimulated
   thinking processes. Stimulation occurring through design entity
   questioning had the strongest relationship with generative thinking
   processes. Although creativity-relevant generative processes are
   stimulated by collaborative activity, this does not necessarily mean
   that collaboration results in a more creative product. However, these
   patterns can be used in future work to develop methods and interventions
   for promoting group idea generation and improving group creativity.}},

Title = {{Collective intentionality and the social status of artifactual kinds}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR 2}},
Abstract = {{There is a well-developed view of artifacts according to which their
   nature depends on the intentions of their authors or creators. However,
   in the modern world of artifact design and creation, typically not one
   but many agents are involved in the process of making an artifact. In
   this paper, I show how the intentional view can be maintained even for
   `collective' artifacts having multiple authors. My approach is to
   combine some basic concepts that have been proposed in the study of
   collective intentionality with a suitable model of artifact creation
   that takes account of the multiple agents and processes that arise in
   design, engineering and manufacturing a new or existing product. In this
   way, we can explain how an artifactual kind can be understood via a form
   of collective intentionality. For the design sciences, notions such as
   we-intentionality and group agency can help to model different types of
   cooperation and, in particular, to reconcile individualism with strong
   forms of collectivity at a group level.}},

Title = {{Casting innovative aerospace design case studies in the parameter
   analysis framework to uncover the design process of experts}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 29}},
Abstract = {{Traditional aerospace design methods offer quick and efficient ways to
   generate new designs, but such that often resemble previous ones. For
   truly innovative design, however, a different approach is needed. This
   paper suggests that a general conceptual design method called `parameter
   analysis' (PA) may be used for teaching and practicing innovative
   aerospace design. To support this proposition, we investigate four
   diverse, innovative and unique case studies, all carried out by very
   experienced aerospace designers: the `dam busting' bouncing bomb of
   World War II, the Gossamer Condor human-powered plane of the 1970s, the
   asymmetric Boomerang twin-engine plane of the 1990s and the SpaceShipOne
   suborbital spacecraft of the early 2000s. The paper elaborates on how
   the methodology of case-study research has been adapted and applied to
   provide the evidence supporting the research hypothesis, and presents
   the results of analyzing the case studies. It shows that the expert
   aerospace designers followed a thought process similar to PA, even if
   unknowingly, where the similarity was measured by counting the number of
   PA characteristics that could be shown to exist in the case studies.
   Advantages and limitations of the research methodology are also
   discussed.}},

Title = {{How to assess a company's open innovation situation?}},
Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 26}},
Abstract = {{Open Innovation (OI) supports companies in systematically collaborating
   with external partners, offering various advantages. However, companies
   still face several challenges when applying OI, e.g., identifying
   relevant OI partners, collaboration methods, and project risks. Often,
   insufficient planning is the reason for subsequent deficits in OI
   projects. The analysis of relevant context factors ('situation') is
   important, which affect and constrain OI. To date, a general approach
   for analyzing (open) innovation situations or guidelines for developing
   one do not exist. Usually researchers develop their own situation
   analysis, including extensive literature reviews and experiencing
   similar challenges. This publication sets the basis for successfully
   planning OI projects. It focuses on developing an analysis approach for
   OI situations and supports other researchers in developing their own
   analysis approaches. The resultant objectives of the publication are to:
   (1) provide a list of potential situation analysis criteria; (2) provide
   a guideline for developing a situation analysis; (3) provide initial
   indications of relevant OI-specific situation criteria. The criteria
   were derived from the literature and qualitatively evaluated by three
   industry partners to assess their usability. Although this work is
   exploratory, and the results are not automatically generalizable, it is
   an important contribution for ensuring the success of OI, and for
   analyzing enablers and barriers to knowledge transfer from academia to

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Innovation Engineering (IE) is an educational training program that
   presents tools and advice on product innovation in three main
   categories: Create, idea generation; Communicate, communicating ideas;
   and Commercialize, selecting ideas to invest in further. The concepts
   taught in IE include common suggestions for early-stage product
   innovation. This paper addresses a challenge of implementing the IE
   program, specifically that it does not provide peer-reviewed sources or
   adequate data to substantiate its approach. This lack of substantiation
   limits effective implementation at companies. This paper also takes a
   step in examining IE's claims that it is `a new science' and a `new
   field of academic study', a topic motivated by the Design Science
   Journal's aim to serve as the archival venue of science-based design
   knowledge across multiple disciplines. This paper provides a compilation
   of academic literature that has tested the tools and advice espoused by
   IE. Almost all included papers contain test-versus-control experimental
   evidence. A mix of supporting and refuting evidence was found. Overall,
   the work provides a useful compilation of evidence-of-effectiveness
   related to common innovation and design practices that spans different
   design stages and is applicable for multiple disciplines and industries.
   This evidence comes from a variety of sources, including design,
   engineering education, psychology, marketing, and management. The work
   can also serve as an approach to evaluate overarching approaches to
   design in general, specifically, testing the foundations by vetting
   related test-versus-control experimental studies.}},

Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Complex systems are challenging to design, particularly when they
   contain multi-level organizations with non-obvious relationships among
   design components. Here, we investigate engineering students' capacity
   to search for optimal nanoscale biosystem designs with stochastic
   component and system behaviors. The study aims to characterize
   information types that facilitate human learning and improve their
   complex system understanding and design proficiency. It is hypothesized
   that learning parametric system relationships and/or inter-level causal
   mechanisms improves design proficiency; these relationships and
   mechanisms are teachable through software interfaces. Two contrasting
   learning/design interfaces were developed that presented differing
   information types: an interface with performance charts that emphasized
   parametric relationship learning and an interface with agent-based
   animations that emphasized inter-level causality learning. Users
   improved on pre-/post-learning design tasks with both interfaces; users
   who demonstrated inter-level causal relationship understanding, which
   occurred primarily with the animation interface, had greater
   improvement. All users were then presented contrasting animations of
   systems with opposing emergent behaviors, resulting in many more
   participants demonstrating an understanding of inter-level causal
   behaviors. These findings reveal the difficulties in understanding and
   designing multi-level systems and that interactive software tools may
   convey crucial information that supports engineering design,
   particularly with respect to the development of reasoning skills for how
   system components relate across levels.}},

Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{`Innovation' has become a buzzword in academic papers, news articles,
   and book titles, but it is variously defined and is often referred to as
   `invention' or `design'. A consensus of understanding the
   interrelationships of the concepts and activities pertaining to
   innovation is needed to guide collective action for innovation. This
   paper proposes a united view of the innovation process, which advocates
   uniting the complementary (1) science, (2) design, and (3)
   entrepreneurship sub-processes of innovation. The shared creative,
   uncertain, and costly nature of these three processes also implies an
   opportunity to leverage design science to understand and guide the
   science and entrepreneurship processes. This paper describes the
   benefits, major challenges, and actionable strategies for uniting
   science, design, and entrepreneurship as sub-processes of innovation,
   with a few detailed real life examples. The variety of the cases and
   examples shows that science, design, and entrepreneurship sub-processes
   can be effectively united to different extents, within and across

Journal = {{DESIGN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Research supports the central role cognitive strategies can play in
   successful concept generation by individual designers. Design heuristics
   have been shown to facilitate the creation of new design concepts in the
   early, conceptual stage of the design process, as well as throughout the
   development of ideas. However, we know relatively little about their use
   in differing disciplines. This study examined evidence of design
   heuristic use in a protocol study with 12 mechanical engineers and 12
   industrial designers who worked individually to develop multiple
   concepts. The open-ended design problem was for a novel product, and the
   designers' sketches and comments were recorded as they worked on the
   problem for 25 min and in a retrospective interview. The results showed
   frequent use of design heuristics in both disciplines and a significant
   relationship to the rated creativity of the concepts. Though industrial
   designers used more heuristics in their concepts, there was a high
   degree of similarity in heuristic use. Some differences between design
   disciplines were observed in the choice of design heuristics, where
   industrial designers showed a greater emphasis on user experience,
   environmental contexts, and added features. These findings demonstrate
   the prevalence of design heuristics in individual concept generation and
   their effectiveness in generating creative concepts, across two design
   domains.}},
