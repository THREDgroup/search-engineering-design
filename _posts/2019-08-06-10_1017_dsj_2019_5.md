Increasingly, products are designed for global markets, yet studies of
   design practices primarily investigate designers from high-income
   countries. Specifically, the use of prototypes during design is likely
   affected by the background of the designer and the environment in which
   they are designing. To broaden our understanding of the extent to which
   prototyping best practices are used beyond Western designers, in this
   study, we conducted interviews with novice designers from Ghana, a
   middle-income country (MIC), to examine how Ghanaian novice designers
   (upper-level undergraduate students) used prototypes throughout their
   design courses. We compared the reported use of prototypes to best
   practice behaviors and analyzed the types of prototypes used. We found
   evidence that these Ghanaian novice designers used some critical
   prototyping best practice behaviors, while other behaviors were
   underutilized, specifically during the front-end phases of design and
   for the purpose of engaging with stakeholders. Additionally, virtual
   models dominated their prototyping choices. We discuss likely reasons
   for these trends based on participants' design experiences and design
   contexts.
