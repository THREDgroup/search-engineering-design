Perceived quality refers to customers' cognitive and emotional responses
   to a particular design, often also associated with craftsmanship and
   customer satisfaction. Previous research defined a taxonomy of perceived
   quality and provided understanding about how engineering design
   decisions impact customer satisfaction. Furthermore, development of new
   products is frequently based on carrying over attributes of existing
   products, either from the same producer or from competitors. Previous
   research offered a new product development methodology combining
   variations of subsystems to carry over from existing products. This
   brief presents how these two lines of research combined to design the
   central console of the Porsche Panamera automobile and discusses the
   opportunities and challenges posed in the practical implementation of
   this research.
