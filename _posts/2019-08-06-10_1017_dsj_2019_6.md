Travelers interact with a large number and variety of products and
   services during their journeys. The quality of a travel experience
   depends on a whole urban mobility system considered in space and time.
   This paper outlines the relevant concepts to be considered in designing
   urban mobility. The goal is to provide a language and insights for the
   early stages of a design process. A literature review sheds light on the
   complexity of urban mobility from technical, sociotechnical, and user
   experience perspectives. Observations of experiences in urban areas
   provide data for describing and understanding travel experience patterns
   and issues. The paper proposes a conceptual model to describe and
   analyze different facets of traveler experience and categorizes problems
   that travelers face when they interact with an urban mobility system. A
   case study is reported illustrating the use of the conceptual model in
   identifying travel problems for a demand-responsive transport service.
