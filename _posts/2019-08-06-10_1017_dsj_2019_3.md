The terms design and innovation are intuitively related, but the
   relationship between these two concepts is more complex and subtle than
   it appears at first sight. Few authors have made rigorous attempts to
   explore this relationship in depth, and the contributions present in the
   literature generally suffer the specialist backgrounds on which they are
   grounded. Consequently, this paper provides a high-level synthesis of
   the innovation management domain and defines an original framework that
   allows the positioning of the concepts from Innovation Management that
   are most relevant for scholars and practitioners operating in the Design
   domain. Specifically, this framework provides a concise representation
   of the typologies of innovation activities along the technology
   lifecycle, and associates them to their business implications and to
   technical and organizational implications on the design process. This
   framework allows scholars and practitioners from both fields to identify
   the typical design challenges that are inherent to each type of
   innovation activity, and to evaluate the suitability of specific support
   methods and tools.
