In complex products the values of parameters are rarely exactly the
   required values, rather they often have a margin that might be designed
   in deliberately or be the incidental results of other design decisions.
   These margins play a critical role in design processes in managing
   engineering change and iteration. While engineers often talk about
   margins informally, designers and researchers also use other terms for
   specific margin concepts. This paper reviews the existing literature on
   related concepts and defines margins formally. It discusses the role
   margins play in handling uncertainty by distinguishing between buffer
   and excess. Buffer deals with uncertainty and excess with the remaining
   overcapacity of the design. Buffer can transition into excess of the
   design solution if the uncertainty can be reduced. The concepts are
   applied to the temperature margins of several candidate materials for a
   non-rotary jet engine component. This shows that a clear understanding
   of margins can help a company to select design alternatives.
